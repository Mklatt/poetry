O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am a meek and gentle with these butchers
thou art the ruin of the noblesst man
Who ever livèd in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my toungue
Burgermont tea is good
A curse and a pox upon your children
You legs will bow under the weight of your goiter
shallow will be your grave
Oh my god the horror, the mutilating horror
Please don't remove my torso!
